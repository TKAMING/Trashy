# Trashy (CS50-Final-Project)
Trashy is a website to manage garbage cans. 
You can get a account as an admin and provide via Trashy a service for your neighbourhood.
Then your neighbours can go to the Trashy website fill out the form which cans you have to put out and where.
Then the provider have to go and check the list of registert users + put the trash cans in front of the doors of the users that filled out the form.
Ofcours will the user have to pay for this service.
